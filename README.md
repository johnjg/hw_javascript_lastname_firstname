I apologize for the late submission, but I was convinced that I would be able to figure out the inception script and I did not want to give up on it. I have been working on that one section of this assignment for several days. I didn't see the point in turning in something that I knew did not function properly, though in retrospect I probably would have received a better grade for just accepting that I wasn't going to get it. It is now 3:00am and I have tried everything that I can think of.

I do not believe that we have been adequately prepared for a problem of this nature. I can find no similar example problems in our lectures or our resources. The Development Tools provide error messages, but we haven't learned enough about the Dev Tools to get useful feedback from it that might lead to a solution. This specific problem was debated at length by our class "study group", which is comprised of literally every member of the class. I have never before attended a class in my very long academic career in which the entire class felt it necessary to voluntarily form a study group, which I fear is only going to lead to additional confusion and misinformation. I was definitely not alone in feeling completely lost and unprepared for this problem. The solution that the study group came up with seemed suspicious and beyond the scope of the material that we have covered in class, so I decided to try to come up with a solution grounded in what we have already learned. I could not. I honestly have no idea how to approach this problem and I look forward to discussing it in our next class.
